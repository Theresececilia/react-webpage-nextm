Studying Bachelor and Master of Multimedia Arts with a focus on audio and having the opportunity to work as Audio Producer in different media mediums such as advertisement, video games and podcasts gave me a clear vision of the overall procedures happening in media and entertainment industry. On top of all, I've had the honor to learn from some of the bests in the industry and teach those skills in my personal workshops, university-supported workshops and as teaching assistant in my university. Lastly, some may count this as my weakness, but when I start doing something, only the best quality satisfies me, even if the odds are not in my favor."
