Games and interactive stories are my biggest passion, and my vibe is to make the story playable, unforgettable, and beloved by millions.

Maybe not so much when there's bugs, but the feeling of solving the problem and to have learned something new is remarkable. I really like the UX part of building websites, probably because of my background in behavioural science, and I have gotten my eyes up for backend development and hope to explore that area more in the future. To be in a field of work where there is so many areas to choose from can be overwhelming but I love the opportunity of meeting people with different areas of expertise and learning from it!"

Studying Bachelor and Master of Multimedia Arts with a focus on audio and having the opportunity to work as Audio Producer in different media mediums such as advertisement, video games and podcasts gave me a clear vision of the overall procedures happening in media and entertainment industry. On top of all, I've had the honor to learn from some of the bests in the industry and teach those skills in my personal workshops, university-supported workshops and as teaching assistant in my university. Lastly, some may count this as my weakness, but when I start doing something, only the best quality satisfies me, even if the odds are not in my favor."
